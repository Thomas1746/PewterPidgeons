# PewterPidgeons

This is the repository for PewterPidgeons, a team for a game jam by the name of <a href="https://blujam.nz/">BluJam</a>. We are given 48 hours to build a game without any external libraries or addons, only using the ECS100 library (a library specially created to help first year VUW Engineering and CompSci students learn Java without having to deal with the likes of swing) or Processing. The special theme for this game jam is, fittingly, the colour blue.

**Team Members**

Sanjay - coding, engine
Klimpen - coding, maze generation
Thomas - the other stuff (modelling, animation, music, textures) and some coding
