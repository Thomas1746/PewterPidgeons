# PewterPidgeons

## Context

This is the repository for PewterPidgeons, a team for a game jam by the name of <a href="https://blujam.nz/">BluJam 2017</a>. We are given 48 hours to build a game without any external libraries or addons, only using the ECS100 library (a library specially created to help first year VUW Engineering and CompSci students learn Java without having to deal with the likes of swing) or Processing. The special theme for this game jam is, fittingly, the colour blue.

## Team Members

* Sanjay - coding, engine
* Klimpen - coding, maze generation
* Thomas - the other stuff (modelling, animation, sound, textures) and some coding

## The Game

We have created a multiplayer PvP 3D dungeon crawler first person shooter. You play as a scorpion and are dropped somewhere in a dungeon maze, your goal being to defeat the other scorpions before they defeat you. All enemies and items are invisible to you unless you have the special blue transparent UI window or "lens" over the screen in the right place. The trade-off is that, because you click on the screen to shoot from your stinger, you can't shoot your opponent without moving the window out of the way. You must find your opponent with the minimap then put your quick reflexes into action the moment you come face to face and see them through your lens.

## Results

We spent our last few hours implementing all the features we wanted to implement, but we also ended up adding new and unexpected bugs to our previously fully functional game. We didn't win overall, but we won "most creative game," which we are pleased with considering the circumstances. The concept is a bit out there, but the lens could also fit in a more puzzle-based environment to reveal secrets, as long as there's a penalty to stop the user having the lens on the screen at all time. Next time we will be sure to use those last few hours on testing, as a game that's functionally complete is far superior to a slightly flashier one which fails at its core.
